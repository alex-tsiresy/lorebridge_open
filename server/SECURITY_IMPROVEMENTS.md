# Security Improvements Applied

This document summarizes all the security and privacy improvements applied to the LoreBridge authentication flow.

## üîí **Critical Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Fixed Unauthenticated User Creation Endpoint**
- **Issue**: User creation endpoint lacked authentication
- **Fix**: Added clerk authentication requirement and user ID verification
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized user creation and enumeration attacks

### 2. **Fixed Webhook Signature Verification Bypass**
- **Issue**: Webhook verification was skipped when secret not configured
- **Fix**: Made webhook secret mandatory and reject requests without proper verification
- **Impact**: Prevents webhook spoofing and unauthorized data manipulation

### 3. **üö® CRITICAL: Fixed Authorization Bypass Vulnerabilities**
- **Issue**: Multiple endpoints missing user isolation checks allowing data leakage
- **Affected Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /graphs/{graph_id}/nodes/` - Could access any graph's nodes
  - `GET /artefacts/{artefact_id}` - Could access any user's artefacts
  - `GET /graphs/{graph_id}/edges/` - Could access any graph's edges
- **Fix**: Added proper user ownership verification before data access
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized access to other users' sensitive data
- **Update**: Added user_id field to Artefact model and updated all creation/access endpoints

### 4. **Secured CORS Configuration**
- **Issue**: Hardcoded CORS origins and overly permissive settings
- **Fix**: Use settings-based configuration with specific allowed methods/headers
- **Impact**: Reduces cross-origin attack surface

### 5. **Implemented Error Message Sanitization**
- **Issue**: Detailed internal errors exposed to users
- **Fix**: Created `SecurityUtils` class with sanitized error messages
- **Impact**: Prevents information disclosure while maintaining debugging capability

### 6. **Added Comprehensive File Upload Validation**
- **Issue**: Missing file type, size, and security validation
- **Fix**: Added MIME type checking, size limits, and filename sanitization
- **Impact**: Prevents malicious file uploads and path traversal attacks

### 7. **Implemented Comprehensive API Rate Limiting**
- **Issue**: No protection against abuse or DoS attacks
- **Fix**: Added slowapi-based rate limiting across ALL endpoints with appropriate limits
- **Applied to**: Upload, chat, processing, read, create, and webhook endpoints
- **Impact**: Protects against brute force and resource exhaustion attacks

### 8. **Standardized Authorization Patterns**
- **Issue**: Inconsistent authentication handling across endpoints
- **Fix**: Created reusable auth decorators and applied user isolation consistently
- **Impact**: Reduces authorization bugs and improves maintainability

### 9. **Enhanced Logging Security**
- **Issue**: Verbose logging with potential sensitive data exposure
- **Fix**: Added request ID middleware and structured logging across all endpoints
- **Impact**: Better security monitoring without exposing sensitive information

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features Added**

### Rate Limiting
- **Upload endpoints**: 5 requests/minute
- **Chat endpoints**: 30 requests/minute
- **Create operations**: 20 requests/minute
- **Read operations**: 200 requests/minute
- **Processing operations**: 10 requests/minute
- **General API endpoints**: 100 requests/minute
- **Webhook endpoints**: 10 requests/minute

### File Upload Security
- MIME type validation (PDF only)
- File size limits (configurable)
- Filename sanitization
- Path traversal prevention

### Error Handling
- Generic error messages for users
- Detailed logging for administrators
- Request ID correlation
- Structured error responses

### Request Tracking
- Unique request IDs
- Client IP logging
- User agent tracking
- Response time monitoring

## üöÄ **Implementation Status**

All critical security fixes have been implemented:

‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Fix unauthenticated user creation endpoint
- Fix webhook signature verification bypass  
- Fix CORS configuration to use settings
- Sanitize error messages to prevent information disclosure

6. **Documentation**: Update API documentation with new rate limits

### Production Checklist:
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Run database migration to add user_id to artefacts
- [ ] Configure webhook secret in environment
- [ ] Install new dependencies
- [ ] Update CORS origins for production domains
- [ ] Monitor error logs for security events
- [ ] Test rate limiting behavior
- [ ] Verify file upload restrictions work correctly
- [ ] Verify artefact user isolation is working correctly

## üìä **Security Impact**

These improvements significantly enhance the security posture by:

- **Eliminating** critical authentication bypasses
- **Preventing** information disclosure through error messages
- **Protecting** against file upload attacks
- **Mitigating** brute force and DoS attacks
- **Improving** auditability and incident response
