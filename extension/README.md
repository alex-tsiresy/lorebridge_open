## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Content not extracting properly:**
- Works best on article pages, content-focused websites, and supported chat platforms
- Some heavily dynamic sites may require a page refresh
- Protected sites (banking, etc.) may have limited functionality
- Chat platforms may need to load messages before extraction (scroll up to load older messages)

**Screenshot not capturing:**
- Ensure the webpage is fully loaded
- Make sure the tab is active and visible
- Some restricted pages may prevent screenshots

**Downloads not working:**
- Check your browser's download settings
- Ensure popup blockers aren't interfering
- Verify you have write permissions to your downloads folder

### Technical Support

If you encounter persistent issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Try disabling and re-enabling the extension
3. Refresh the webpage and try again
